Hi everyone! For our project, Jenny, JC, Varun, 
and I focused on Amazon deforestation. 

2
00:00:07.16 --> 00:00:15.06 align:middle line:90%
So, as you see here, uh, this is our webpage, 
and it's split into three tabs, the first of which 
represents the motivation and background 
for our project.

3
00:00:15.07 --> 00:00:24.24 align:middle line:90%
So, you see we have information about the 
domain, uh, tasks, the use case, the data that 
we sought after, as well as the biases and 
ethics revolved around the data.

4
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:33.01 align:middle line:90%
Uh, the second tab has our two visual 
encodings, the first of which, uh, represents a 
histogram overlaid by a line plot

5
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:39.10 align:middle line:90%
representing, on the x-axis, the 21 years 
involved in our data, so 2000 thr- through 
2021.

6
00:00:39.10 --> 00:00:42.11 align:middle line:90%
And then on the y-axis is the proportion of 
area deforested.

7
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:47.21 align:middle line:90%
And so, with this plot, the user can hover over 
any of the bars, as well as any of the points.

8
00:00:47.21 --> 00:00:54.11 align:middle line:90%
And so if I select the first bar, for example, a 
tooltip will show up on the left side that 
shows the year range representative of that 
bar,

9
00:00:54.11 --> 00:00:58.11 align:middle line:90%
as well as the average proportion of areas 
deforested over that three-year range.

10
00:00:58.11 --> 00:01:09.01 align:middle line:90%
And then, if I click on, say, this point right 
here, a tooltip will show up on the right that 
represents, or that shows, that year of the 
point selected and then the proportion of 
area deforested for that year.

11
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:14.16 align:middle line:90%
And then, whatever point the user selects is 
how the three visualizations are linked.

12
00:01:14.16 --> 00:01:20.01 align:middle line:90%
And so, if we scroll down on this page, on the 
left side is the first plot of Visual Encoding 2,

13
00:01:20.01 --> 00:01:27.01 align:middle line:90%
which is a scatterplot with 200 points 
representative of the percentage of the 
Amazon Rainforest remaining in a certain 
year.

14
00:01:27.01 --> 00:01:36.15 align:middle line:90%
And so, in this case with 2001, uh, all the 
green points represent the proportion of the 
forest that's left, so, in this case, 91.5%.

15
00:01:36.15 --> 00:01:43.01 align:middle line:90%
And the brown dots represent the proportion 
of the forest that's been deforested, so, uh, 
8.5%.

16
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:51.16 align:middle line:90%
And this same data is portrayed in the pie 
chart to the right, which shows the percent 
deforested in this yellow slice, so in this case, 
8.3%.

17
00:01:51.16 --> 00:01:55.01 align:middle line:90%
And then, the green slice is about 91.8%.

18
00:01:55.01 --> 00:02:00.00 align:middle line:90%
And then, at the top, is the third tab, is just 
our resources. Thank you.
